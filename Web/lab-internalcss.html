        <h1>Web Browser</h1>
        <p id="p1">The web browser is an application software to explore www (World Wide Web). 
It provides an interface between the server and the client and requests to the server for web documents and services. 
It works as a compiler to render HTML which is used to design a webpage. Whenever we search anything on the internet, 
the browser loads a web page written in HTML, including text, links, images, 
and other items such as style sheets and JavaScript functions.</p>
   <h1>Web Server</h1>
 <p class="p2">A web server is software and hardware that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) 
and other protocols to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web. 
The main job of a web server is to display website content through storing, processing and delivering webpages to users. 
Besides HTTP, web servers also support SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) and 
FTP (File Transfer Protocol), used for email, file transfer and storage.</p>
